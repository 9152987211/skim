SKIM is a cosy COOP stone skimming game. You and your friends can look for stones on the ground and compete to see who can get the most bounces on the lake.

This game uses Unity Relay which allows clients to connect to each other without the need for port forwarding, a join code is all that is needed. The multiplayer architecture is client-server but in a way where one of the clients acts as a server, making them the host.
